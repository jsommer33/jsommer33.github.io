I'm a graduate student in Robotics at Georgia Tech, with a background in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Notre Dame. My work sits at the intersection of robotics, biomedical engineering, and experimental design, with a focus on creating devices that can make a meaningful impact in clinical environments.

Currently, I work in the Biomedical Mechatronics Lab (BM2) where I lead the development of MRI-compatible robotic systems for minimally invasive procedures. This includes a concentric tube robot for intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) evacuation, tested across in vivo and ex vivo experiments, and a steerable catheter for Holmium Laser Enucleation of the Prostate (HoLEP) with integrated tracking for real-time MRI-guided control. My projects often involve mechanical design, actuation control, and image-guided planning, combining hardware prototyping with software tools like MATLAB, ROS, and CNN-based segmentation models.

I also co-founded a MedTech startup through Georgia Tech’s Create-X program, focused on expanding MRI usage in surgery through a robotic assistance platform. Across my projects, I aim to bridge the gap between engineering innovation and clinical application—from concept and design to testing and translation.
